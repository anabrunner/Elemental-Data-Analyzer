# Elemental-Data-Analyzer
A script for sorting and cleaning data from chemical analysis.

A lab runs routine ICP-OES analysis on different water samples to measure elemental composition. The samples can be from an aquarium, river, or lake water source. Each water source has different reporting requirements even though they are analyzed together, in no particular order. This script cleans up and sorts the sample data, organizing like samples into a single file with just the required reporting elements.
